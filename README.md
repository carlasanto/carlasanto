👋 Hi, I’m @carlasanto.
👀 I'm passionate about blockchain programming, particularly with Solidity, and exploring its wide-ranging applications. Another area of keen interest to me is cybersecurity.
🌱 I'm experienced with tools such as Python, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nessus, risk analysis tools, and more. I have knowledge in security frameworks, risk analysis, and vulnerabilities, including PCI DSS, ISO 27001, NIST, COBIT, GDPR, and Magerit.
💞️ I'm actively seeking collaboration on projects related to Solidity programming and connecting with individuals who are dedicated to continuous learning and growth.
